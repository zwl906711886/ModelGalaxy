# AutoMRM
AutoMRM is a user-task-centric multimodal model retrieval method .
Here is the implementation of the paper "AutoMRM: A Model Retrieval Method Based on Multimodal
Query and Metalearning".

It consists of the following parts:
  1) Metafeature: The feature extraction of the proposed method and baselines.
  2) Evaluation: The performance evaluation of all candidate models on different tasks.
  3) Training&Test: The training and test of meta models.
  



##Requirements:
Different parts of the code depend on different environments, please refer to readme and import:
python = 3.7.13
pytorch = 1.13.0 
clip = 1.0
numpy = 1.21.6
scikit-learn  =  1.0.2
